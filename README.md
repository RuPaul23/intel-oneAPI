#### Problem Statement - Early Warning System for Student Dropouts
#### Team Leader Email - paulrohit2021@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
  
  The idea is to develop an early warning system for student dropouts using Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, its libraries, and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries. The system will use machine learning algorithms to identify students who are at risk of dropping out of 
school. The system will be scalable, cost friendly and innovative, and it will help improve student retention rates and promote equitable access to quality education. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for such a system, as student dropouts 
have become a major challenge faced by the education sector which in turn results in various other problems like drug addiction , poverty and many more. By leveraging the power of Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits and its libraries, we can develop a 
solution that can help address this challenge and hopefully solve it for greater good.
