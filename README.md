## A Brief of the Prototype:
  This section must include UML Daigrms and prototype description
  
  The idea is to develop an early warning system for student dropouts using Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, its libraries, and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries. The system will use machine learning algorithms to identify students who are at risk of dropping out of 
school. The system will be scalable, cost friendly and innovative, 
and it will help improve student retention rates and promote 
equitable access to quality education. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has highlighted the need for such a system, as student dropouts 
have become a major challenge faced by the education sector 
which in turn results in various other problems like drug 
addiction , poverty and many more. By leveraging the power of 
Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits and its libraries, we can develop a 
solution that can help address this challenge and hopefully solve it 
for greater good
  
## Tech Stack: 
   List Down all technologies used to Build the prototype **Clearly mentioning Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, it's libraries and the SYCL/DCP++ Libraries used**
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype, so that it can be tested and deeply analysed
  
## What I Learned:
   Write about the biggest learning you had while developing the prototype
